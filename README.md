Gathers the cheatsheet payloads and creates a usable wordlist
  
THANK YOU PORTSWIGGER FOR ALL YOUR AMAZING WORK AND EFFORT :heart:
  
Just build or run the script as is, no args needed. The rest should be handled for you.
  
Disclaimer: Not the cleanest code but it works :)  
Cheatsheet: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet

Thank you ArenasDev for adding the following parameters and functionality:
-tag for tag filtering  
-event for event filtering  
-filename for setting the name of the filtered list  
-update to force update (it wont update if there is an existing payload file)  

### License  
I'm just a simple skid. Licensing isn't a big issue to me, I post things that I find helpful online in the hope that others can:  
 A) learn from the code  
 B) find use with the code or   
 C) need to just have a laugh at something to make themselves feel better  
  
Either way, if this helped you - cool :)
